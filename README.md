# 🚗📡 ToF Obstacle Avoidance Expansion (VL53L0X + I2C MUX)

## 📖 Overview
This repository documents the design and validation of a custom **I2C expansion PCB** based on the **TCA9548A multiplexer**, intended to interface **four VL53L0X Time-of-Flight (ToF) sensors** for a mobile robot car platform.

The main goal is to enhance the robot’s perception and reliability for **obstacle detection and avoidance**, improving robustness under real conditions such as wiring movement, vibration, and multi-sensor I2C limitations.

## 🔗 Project Context

This ToF sensor expansion board is part of the ongoing hardware upgrades for the **Assisted-Trajectory Robot Car project**.

The main project repository documents the overall robot platform, including mechanical setup, drive-by-wire control architecture, and system integration:

- **Assisted-Trajectory Robot Car – Main Project Repository**  
  [Assisted-Trajectory Robot Car](https://github.com/CrissCCL/Robot_Car)

This repository focuses exclusively on the **obstacle detection stage**, using an **I2C multiplexer (TCA9548A)** to reliably interface **four VL53L0X Time-of-Flight sensors** distributed around the robot chassis.

The goal is to provide consistent short-range distance measurements that enable **obstacle avoidance behavior**, improving navigation reliability under real operating conditions (vibration, wiring movement, and multi-sensor I2C constraints).

## ⚙️ System Description — Robot ToF Expansion
- **Controller (Master):** Teensy 4.0 (3.3V I2C)
- **MUX:** TCA9548A I2C multiplexer
- **Sensors:** 4× VL53L0X ToF
- **Purpose:** short-range ranging and obstacle detection for autonomous navigation
- **Integration target:** assisted-trajectory robot car platform


## 🧩 Hardware Notes — I2C Robustness
This PCB is designed to solve common multi-sensor I2C issues in robotic environments, including:
- Unstable readings when wires are moved
- Multiple sensors with fixed I2C addresses
- Increased bus capacitance due to distributed sensor placement
- Noise and interference from motors and power electronics

The **TCA9548A** isolates each sensor on its own channel, improving stability and simplifying troubleshooting.


## 🔌 MUX Channel Allocation (Planned)
Example mapping (can be adapted based on the robot layout):

- **CH0** → VL53L0X (Front-Left)
- **CH1** → VL53L0X (Front-Right)
- **CH2** → VL53L0X (Rear-Left)
- **CH3** → VL53L0X (Rear-Right)

## 🗺️ Sensor Placement (Concept)
The following figure shows a **conceptual sensor placement** on the robot chassis.  
It is a **vector-style illustration** intended only to communicate the integration idea and expected coverage zones.

> Note: sensor positions may change depending on mechanical constraints, wiring and field test results.


## 🧪 Firmware Validation Plan
The firmware development will include:
1) **MUX channel scan** (detect ACK responses per channel)  
2) **ToF distance reading test** sequentially per channel  
3) Integration into the robot logic for **obstacle detection** and decision-making
